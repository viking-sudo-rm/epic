Alas, we enter bright {CITY}:
Bright with the fires of war,
the inner fires of enemies
And comrades who fight them.
Those same fires burn brightest 
In their extinction, and small pyres
Act as makeshift funerals across the city.
It seems as if these flames
May envelop the whole city,
As if they have their own pull,
Wicking in lives and rooves and towers
- why else would they crumble?

{PLAYER} stands at a cross-roads,
Awaited in the square,
Expected to connect sword to skin,
An alloy of iron and flesh
That offers slim chances of success,
But the only hope of restoring the city,
If anything more than ruins
Could ever survive the conflict.

On the right, a golden ticket out of the city:
The fields of Poseidon gleam and roll,
Delineating fire and arousing - cruelly - hope,
As if it has any right to do so
In the midst of wars of men,
And beseigement.
