{HERO.name} reached out {HERO.pronoun.gen} hand
To touch Iustititia's palm.
That touch of hands,
The meeting of life and death,
Shocked the nether realm,
Tore its very fabric
into a portal.

{HERO.name} and Iustitia jumped
Into the unknown gate,
Traversed many abstract realms,
Until suddenly,
In a sleepy wood
Besides a temple
Wrapped in years of moss,
Together they appeared.
