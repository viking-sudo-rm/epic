Burning with passion, Maliket took {HERO.name} to a wild cave.
Seeing their union, the gods let fertile rain and lightning fall.
They were one as divine thunders echoes over the skies -
A boom of hope in a world harnessed by duty and disappointment.

"Stay!" says Maliket. "What we each had was lost;
Now we can be reborn together:
A new life, a new nation, a new child.
Never again brave the cold ocean's breeze:
Remain forever by the warmth of my hearth!"
