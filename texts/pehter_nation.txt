Pehter spoke:

"Our nation, Ilion,
that you shall rebuild on foreign shores!"

"Others will excel at stargazing,
At reaching new lands,
At the arts of marble and word.
Ilion's strength is Order,
Bringing peace to every land.
Remember to lift up the oppressed,
And to crush the haughty."

{HERO.name} drifted off to sleep.
{HERO.pronoun.nom} awoke in a field,
And glimpsed a gleaming city in the distance.
