I sing of order and chaos,
A tale of cities falling and rising,
Defenders and conquerors, 
Hateful heroes and pious villains,
Travellers and founders alike.

Oh Muse, let such a worldly tale be compiled,
and guide the hero's hand as you guide my memory.
For the hero's adventures order the poet's words.
