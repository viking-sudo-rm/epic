I sing of order and chaos,
A tale of cities rising and falling,
Defenders and conquerors, 
Heroes, villains, the Ego,
One's own place among the stars.

Let us become travelers and founders,
Let us flee homes and raze others,
Sowing seeds on trampled earth
And salting a lover's lands.
May we live and die by the asp,
And see even civil conclusions to foreign war.

Oh Muse, let such a worldly tale be compiled,
Weave together the chords of fate, 
and guide the hero's hand as you do my words,
Ever to remain in our memory.
For here the adventure gives order to Logos,
And the snaking path cuts off with a forked tongue,
One hundred branches on this side, two hundred on that. 

But it all begins with one man...
