Or one woman, in fact.

Unlucky Dido tries her hand at changing fate,
No longer a play-thing of the gods,
Nor harboring a vagrant, his son,
And an ill-starred love in her breast.
She is strong-willed after the death of Sychaeus, 
Determined to continue, but not to succumb again
To the deceptive throes of marriage.

She rises from the ashes of a former life,
and into the {CITY}.
