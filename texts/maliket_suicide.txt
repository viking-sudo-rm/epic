From the roof of her palace,
Maliket glimpsed leaving sails.
{HERO.name}, her new life, was gone.

She ordered a pyre built and climbed it.
Smoke and wailing crawled from the flames into the night sky.
{HERO.name} saw from the ship - everyone could.

Did {HERO.pronoun.nom} return her tears,
Or did they remain, like her love, unrequited?
