Alas, we enter bright {CITY}:
Bright with the fires of war,
and the inner fires of enemies,
of comrades who fight them.
Those same fires burn brightest 
In their extinction, and small pyres
Act as makeshift funerals across {CITY}.
Looking around, it seems these flames
May envelop the whole city,
As if they have their own pull,
Wicking in lives and rooves and towers
- why else would they crumble? -
And the sight is a fearsome one indeed.

{HERO.name} stands at a cross-roads,
Awaited in the square,
Expected to connect sword to skin,
An alloy of iron and flesh
That offers slim chances of success
- still the only hope of restoring the city -
Assuming anything more than ruins
Can survive the destructive conflict.

On the right, a golden ticket out of the city:
The fields of Poseidon gleam and roll,
Delineating fire and arousing - cruelly - hope,
As if it has any right to do so
In the midst of wars of men,
And foul beseigement.
