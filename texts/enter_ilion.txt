Our tale starts with war:
The city {CITY},
Bright with the inner fires of enemies,
Of comrades who fight them.

{HERO.name} stands at a cross-roads,
A doomed defender,
Expected to connect sword to skin,
An alloy of iron and flesh
That offers slim chances of success
- still the only hope of restoring the city -
Assuming anything more than ruins
Can survive the destructive conflict.

On the right, a golden ticket out of the city:
The fields of Poseidon gleam and roll,
Delineating fire and arousing - cruelly - hope,
As if it has any right to do so
In the midst of wars of men,
And foul beseigement.

A hard choice our hero faces:
To leave and live, or fight and die?
